## Winter Olympic Games --- EDA

The Project focuses on data wrangling and visualization. I combine thrre sources of datasets, tidy the resulting datasets, create summary statistics and visualization to find a trend between the number of athletes from different countries and the total medals they acquire during the events and a relationship between the number of coaches and the total number of medals for that specific country.
